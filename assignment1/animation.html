        <h2><u>Animation & Motion Graphics</u><br><br>
             The Animation and Motion Graphics program provides students with the fundamentals of two- and three- dimensional (2D and 3D) animation, motion graphics, and special effects. Once necessarily hand-made, expensive and rare, animation has undergone a technical transformation and is now a ubiquitous part of special effect, advertising campaigns, video games, movies, and television.<br><br>
            
              Upon completion of the program requirements, the Associate of Science degree in Animation and Motion Graphics is awarded. Graduates of this program can enter a growing profession or transfer to bachelor-level programs in Animation at Lehman College or other media related programs at senior colleges.
